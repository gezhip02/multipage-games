                    <!-- Introduction -->
                    <p>Puzzle games have been a cornerstone of gaming since the earliest days of the medium. They challenge our minds, test our problem-solving abilities, and provide a unique satisfaction when we finally crack that difficult level. In this guide, we've compiled the top 10 puzzle games that every gamer should experience at least once.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether you're a seasoned puzzle enthusiast or new to the genre, these games offer something special that will keep you engaged for hours on end. From spatial challenges to logic puzzles, from narrative-driven experiences to pure brain-teasers, our list covers a wide range of puzzle types to suit every preference.</p>

                    <!-- Main Section 1 -->
                    <h2>Classic Puzzle Games That Stand the Test of Time</h2>
                    <p>Let's start our journey with some classics that have defined the puzzle genre and continue to captivate players decades after their release.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Tetris</h3>
                    <p>No puzzle game list would be complete without Tetris. Created by Russian engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, this falling block puzzle game has become one of the most recognizable and widely played games of all time.</p>
                    
                    <img src="images/tetris-gameplay.jpg" alt="Tetris gameplay showing falling blocks">
                    
                    <p>What makes Tetris so enduring is its perfect balance of simplicity and depth. The rules are straightforward — arrange falling tetrominoes to create complete lines — but mastering the game requires quick thinking, spatial awareness, and planning several moves ahead. Research has even shown that playing Tetris can improve brain efficiency and help develop problem-solving skills.</p>

                    <h3>2. Minesweeper</h3>
                    <p>This classic Windows game might seem simple at first glance, but Minesweeper is a masterclass in deductive reasoning. The objective is to clear a board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.</p>
                    
                    <p>While it may not have flashy graphics, Minesweeper's elegant design creates tension and rewards careful analysis. It's a perfect example of how a well-designed puzzle game doesn't need visual spectacle to be deeply engaging.</p>
                    
                    <!-- Main Section 2 -->
                    <h2>Modern Puzzle Masterpieces</h2>
                    <p>The puzzle genre has evolved dramatically in recent years, with many modern titles pushing the boundaries of what puzzle games can be. Here are some contemporary standouts that have redefined the genre.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Portal 2</h3>
                    <p>Valve's Portal 2 is widely regarded as one of the greatest puzzle games ever made. Building on the innovative portal mechanics of its predecessor, Portal 2 combines physics-based puzzles with sharp writing and memorable characters.</p>
                    
                    <img src="images/portal2-gameplay.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Portal 2 showing portals">
                    
                    <p>What sets Portal 2 apart is how it seamlessly integrates its puzzles with storytelling. As you navigate through the abandoned Aperture Science facility, you'll encounter increasingly complex challenges that require creative thinking and spatial reasoning. The game's co-op mode also offers a unique collaborative puzzle-solving experience that few other games can match.</p>

                    <h3>4. The Witness</h3>
                    <p>Created by Jonathan Blow (the mind behind Braid), The Witness is a masterpiece of puzzle design set on a beautiful, mysterious island. The game consists of hundreds of line puzzles on panels scattered throughout the island, with each area introducing new rules and concepts without any explicit instructions.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes The Witness special is how it teaches through observation and experimentation rather than direct tutorials. As you progress, you'll have moments of genuine epiphany that feel incredibly rewarding. The island itself is also a puzzle, with environmental clues and hidden connections that reveal deeper layers of meaning.</p>

                    <h3>5. Baba Is You</h3>
                    <p>One of the most innovative puzzle games in recent years, Baba Is You turns the rules of gameplay into puzzle elements themselves. In this unique game, the rules are represented as blocks that can be moved and manipulated, allowing you to change how the game works.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        Baba Is You doesn't just ask you to solve puzzles within a fixed set of rules; it challenges you to rewrite the rules themselves. It's a game that makes you think about how games work at a fundamental level.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>For example, if blocks spell out "WALL IS STOP," walls will block your movement. But if you push those words apart, walls no longer block you. This simple concept leads to mind-bending puzzles that require you to reconsider everything you know about how games function.</p>

                    <!-- Main Section 3 -->
                    <h2>Mobile Puzzle Games Worth Your Time</h2>
                    <p>Mobile platforms have become a thriving ecosystem for puzzle games, offering experiences that take advantage of touch controls and bite-sized play sessions. Here are some mobile puzzlers that stand head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6. Monument Valley</h3>
                    <p>Monument Valley and its sequel are perhaps the most visually stunning puzzle games available on mobile devices. Inspired by the impossible geometries of M.C. Escher, they challenge players to guide a princess through architectural marvels that defy conventional physics.</p>
                    
                    <img src="images/monument-valley.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Monument Valley showing impossible architecture">
                    
                    <p>The beauty of Monument Valley lies in its elegant simplicity. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult, but they're consistently clever and satisfying to solve. Combined with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack and a subtle, emotional narrative, Monument Valley elevates the mobile puzzle game to an art form.</p>

                    <h3>7. The Room Series</h3>
                    <p>Fireproof Games' The Room series offers a tactile puzzle-solving experience perfectly suited to touchscreens. These games place you in front of intricate puzzle boxes filled with hidden compartments, secret mechanisms, and mysterious devices.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes The Room games special is their attention to detail and the satisfying physicality of the puzzles. Each interaction feels meaningful, from turning keys and sliding panels to assembling complex mechanisms. The games also feature an intriguing occult narrative that unfolds as you progress through increasingly complex puzzles.</p>

                    <!-- Main Section 4 -->
                    <h2>Narrative-Driven Puzzle Games</h2>
                    <p>Some of the most compelling puzzle games use their mechanics to tell stories, creating experiences where the puzzles and narrative complement each other perfectly.</p>
                    
                    <h3>8. Return of the Obra Dinn</h3>
                    <p>Created by Lucas Pope (of Papers, Please fame), Return of the Obra Dinn is a detective puzzle game unlike any other. Set aboard an abandoned merchant ship in 1807, you play as an insurance adjuster tasked with determining the fate of each crew member.</p>
                    
                    <p>Using a magical watch that can show you the moment of someone's death, you piece together what happened through careful observation and deductive reasoning. The game's 1-bit graphics style creates a distinctive atmosphere, while the non-linear nature of the investigation allows for genuine "eureka" moments as you connect the dots.</p>

                    <h3>9. The Talos Principle</h3>
                    <p>The Talos Principle combines challenging puzzles with philosophical exploration. As an android with human consciousness, you navigate through ancient ruins solving increasingly complex puzzles while uncovering existential questions about consciousness, humanity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
                    
                    <img src="images/talos-principle.jpg" alt="Screenshot from The Talos Principle showing ancient ruins with puzzle elements">
                    
                    <p>The puzzles themselves involve manipulating laser beams, pressure plates, and blocks to progress, but it's the way these challenges are woven into the game's philosophical narrative that makes The Talos Principle truly special. Few games manage to exercise both your brain and your philosophical thinking as effectively.</p>

                    <h3>10. Fez</h3>
                    <p>At first glance, Fez appears to be a simple 2D platformer. However, it soon reveals its central puzzle mechanic: the ability to rotate the world in 3D while your character, Gomez, experiences it in 2D. This creates mind-bending spatial puzzles where the solution often involves looking at the world from different perspectives.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond its core rotation mechanic, Fez contains layers of hidden puzzles involving cryptography, mathematics, and pattern recognition. Some of these puzzles are so complex and obscure that they required the collective intelligence of the entire player community to solve.</p>

                    <!-- Conclusion -->
